# Stardew Valley App

Stardew Valley is a popular 2D game developed by Eric Barone.
This game has a complex mini-game in which you can catch fish so I made this project to easily detect the fish I want to catch.

**This applications contains all the fish (60) in the game with the following attributes:**
- Name;
- Catching Season;
- Weather;
- Location;
- The Starting Time For Catching A Fish;
- The End Time For Catching A Fish;
- Difficulty;
- Caught/Not caught.

<style>
  body {
    font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;
  }
</style>

**The available functionalities are:**
- Filter Fish by Season, Weather or Caught/Not Caught;
- Search for A Fish After Name;
> [!WARNING]
> *It also has adding, removing, modifying functionalities, but they are tricky ^_^.*

Good luck on catching fish!
